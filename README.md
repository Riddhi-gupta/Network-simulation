# Network-simulation
# Description:
Developed a simulated network environment using GNS3 to practice and demonstrate network security strategies. This project involved creating a virtual network setup, configuring various network devices, and implementing security measures to protect the network against potential threats.

# Tools and Technologies:

GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator)
Cisco IOS Images
Virtual Machines (Here I have used Kali)
Wireshark (Network Protocol Analyzer)
pfSense (Firewall and Router)
Snort (Intrusion Detection System)
OpenVPN (Virtual Private Network)
SSH (Secure Shell)
# Key Features and Activities:

Network Topology Design:

Designed a complex network topology with multiple subnets, routers, switches, and end devices.
Configured IP addressing and subnetting to ensure proper network segmentation.
Firewall Configuration:

Implemented pfSense as a firewall to control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic.
Created firewall rules to allow and block specific traffic based on security policies.
Configured NAT (Network Address Translation) for secure communication between internal and external networks.
VPN Setup:

Set up an OpenVPN server to provide secure remote access to the network.
Configured VPN clients on remote machines to ensure encrypted communication over the internet.
Intrusion Detection System (IDS):

Deployed Snort as an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and potential threats.
Configured Snort rules to detect and alert on various types of network attacks, such as port scanning and SQL injection attempts.
Network Monitoring and Analysis:

Used Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic, identifying any anomalies or malicious activities.
Monitored network performance and security logs to ensure the network remained secure and efficient.
Secure Network Configuration:

Hardened network devices by disabling unnecessary services and securing management interfaces with SSH.
Implemented VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) to segregate network traffic and improve security.
Documentation and Reporting:

Documented the entire network setup process, including device configurations, security policies, and testing procedures.
Generated reports on network performance, security incidents, and mitigation actions taken.
# Outcome:
This project provided hands-on experience in designing, configuring, and securing a network environment. It enhanced my understanding of network security principles, firewall management, VPN setup, and intrusion detection. The simulated environment allowed me to test various security
